# This website deteriorates when you visit it

Every time a user visits the site, the background image get resized a bit, deteriorating it further.
Every 200 visits a reset button appears that can reset the image's quality to its original state, but
only if you're quick enough.

This is a small, ~4 hour experimental project. Nothing fancy.
