	<h1>About</h1>

	<p>
		This website was a small experiment, where each visit to the page deteriorated the main image.
		Every {RESET_INTERVAL} visitors a reset button would appear on the bottom, which could be used to restore
		the image back to its original quality.
		<br />
		<br />
		You could see this website as a metaphor for the effects of tourism, how humanity affects nature,
		or how meme quality degrades over time as they are shared.
		<br />
		<br />
		<b>I've since had to put the website into static mode, since the running costs quickly became too high.</b>
	</p>

	<h2>Timelapse</h2>

	<p>
		I coded a snapshot mechanism to the backend, which saved the current state of the website every 30 seconds.
		You can see a timelapse of the first 11 days of the website's state here:

		P.S. If you choose to post a website/project that you made to Reddit or a similar high-traffic website,
		you have to be really sure that your wallet can handle it.
